Start Wars API-base application

## Initial requirements
Create a catalogue of people in Star Wars, where you can search for people, and be able to see their extra information like what planet they’re from and what year they’re born. We would also like to know what other people come from that same planet, so that should be in there as well. Build it using modern Vanilla javaScript, HTML and SCSS and use the star wars API for content ("http://swapi.dev”). It should have the following features:

·                     Display a simple catalogue of people, with filter and sort options

·                     People detail page with basic info, planet they’re from, and links to people also on that planet

·                     Mobile first and creative user interface ( This is very open, the interface should look how you want it to )

·                     Think about API error handling

We estimate this task to take between 6-8 hours and we will be looking for code quality, application architecture, reusability and UX.
